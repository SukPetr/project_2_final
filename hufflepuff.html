        <h2>About Hufflepuff</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The
            house mascot is the badger, and canary yellow and black (or golden
            yellow and graphite in the Fantastic Beasts films) are its colours.
            During the books, the Head of this house is the Herbology Professor
            Pomona Sprout, and the house ghost is the Fat Friar. According to
            Rowling, Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth. The
            founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff.

            The entrance to the Hufflepuff dormitories and common room entrance
            is concealed in a pile of large barrels in an alcove in the corridor
            that holds the kitchen. To enter, one must tap the barrel two from
            the bottom in the middle of the second row in the rhythm of "Helga
            Hufflepuff". Unlike any other house, the Hufflepuff common room has
            a repelling device that douses the illegal entrant in vinegar if the
            wrong lid is tapped or the rhythm is wrong.[14] The Hufflepuff
            common room is filled with yellow hangings and fat armchairs and it
            has little tunnels leading to the dormitories, all of which have
            perfectly round doors, like barrel tops.
