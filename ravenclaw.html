        <h2>About Ravenclaw</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Ravenclaw values intelligence, learning, wisdom and wit. The house
            mascot is an eagle (raven in the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts
            films) and the house colours are blue and bronze (blue and silver in
            the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films). During the books, the
            head of this house is the Charms teacher, Professor Filius Flitwick,
            and the house ghost is the Grey Lady. According to Rowling,
            Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air. The founder of
            this house is Rowena Ravenclaw.

            The dormitories are in Ravenclaw Tower, on the west side of
            Hogwarts. The common room is round and filled with blue hangings and
            armchairs, has a domed ceiling painted with stars and features a
            replica statue of Rowena wearing her diadem. Harry also notes that
            Ravenclaws "have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains". A
            logical riddle must be solved to gain entry, whereas the Gryffindor
            and Slytherin common rooms only require a password.
