        <h2>About Slytherin</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Slytherin values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness;
            the Sorting Hat said, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,
            that Slytherins will do anything to get their way. The house mascot
            of Slytherin is the serpent, and the house colours are green and
            silver. Throughout the series, until the seventh book, the Head of
            House is Professor Severus Snape. Then, after Snape becomes
            headmaster, the previous Head of House, Professor Horace Slughorn,
            comes out of retirement, re-assuming authority. The ghost of
            Slytherin house is the Bloody Baron. According to Rowling, Slytherin
            corresponds roughly to the element of water. The founder of this
            house is Salazar Slytherin.
          </p>

            The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached by speaking a
            password to a patch of bare stone wall in the dungeons, which causes
            a hidden door to open. The Slytherin common room is a long, low,
            dungeon-style room, under the Hogwarts Lake, furnished with green
            lamps and carved armchairs. The room is described in the second book
            as having a greenish glow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sorting Hat claims that blood purity is a factor in selecting
            Slytherins (first mentioned in the fifth book). There is no actual
            reason to believe that Muggle-born students aren't sorted there, as
            there are several examples of half-bloods in the house - such as
            Snape and Tom Riddle/Voldemort - and Harry himself was only excluded
            from the house at his own insistence. In Deathly Hallows, a group of
            Snatchers claim that "not many Mudbloods" are sorted into Slytherin.
          </p>
          <p>
            When believing Harry to be dead and thinking that he has victory in
            his grasp, Voldemort proclaims his intention to abolish the other
            three houses and force all Hogwarts students into Slytherin. This
            design is foiled by his defeat and death, after which Slytherin
            becomes more diluted in its blood purity, no longer remaining the
            pure-blood bastion it once was.
