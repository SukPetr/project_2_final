  <h2>Hogwarts</h2>
  <p>Hogwarts School, located somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland, 
    consisted of the large Hogwarts Castle and extensive school grounds 
    surrounding it, which included sloping lawns, flowerbeds, vegetabl
    e patches, as well as a loch (called the Black Lake), a 
    large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several 
    greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch
     Pitch. One of the castle's towers held an owlery, which housed
      all the owls owned by the school and by students.</p>



<p>The castle was set upon huge rocks above the Black Lake. 
  Its three highest towers were the Astronomy, Ravenclaw,
   and Gryffindor Towers. The castle's 142 staircases were 
   known to change position. The castle was known for its 
   many updates and changes in layout throughout the years. 
   It should be noted that some rooms in the school tended 
   to "move around", as did the steps on the Grand Staircase.
    Albus Dumbledore once noted that even he did not know all
     of Hogwarts' secrets. The castle had been around for
      centuries, and consequently had a long history of ancient magic.</p>

<p>The school had numerous ancient charms and spells on 
  and around it to safeguard it from danger. In addition
   to the fact that there were enchantments that 
   prevented people from entering by stealth, it was 
   also impossible for a Muggle to see it, as the school
    was bewitched so that when they looked at it, all they
     saw were some old ruins and several warnings of danger.
      Witches and wizards could not Apparate or Disapparate 
      in Hogwarts grounds, except for when the Headmaster
       lifted the enchantment, whether only in certain 
       areas or for the entire campus, so as to make the school
        less vulnerable when it served the headmaster to allow
         Apparition. Electricity and electronic devices were not
          found at Hogwarts. Due to the high levels of magic,
           Muggle substitutes for magic, such as computers, 
           radar and electricity, "went haywire" around Hogwarts.
            Radios, however, were an exception as they were not
             powered by electricity, but by magic.</p>
